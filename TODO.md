## # 0X 
Learnit: Basic network description of your data (what type of network it is, what does it represent, is it real or synthetically generated, etc). In practice, the result of project phase #1 (finding data). 

## #04 Numerical Summaries
Learnit: Basic network statistics of your data (number of nodes, edges, clustering, degree distribution, etc). In practice, the result of project phase #2 (exploratory data analysis).

- [x] Plots of Degree Distribution (how to plot dd of bipartite network?) -> histogram of degrees
- [x] CCDF (inverse/ complement cumulative distribution function) 
- [ ] Power Law Fitting (how does it work with bipartite network?)
- [ ] Stationary Matrix

## #05 Visualisation

MIKA
- [ ] Basic Visualisation of structure of Graph -> very small subgraph -> library that is able to plot bipartite structure
- [ ] Interactive Network Visualisation -> pyvis.Network -> also need to subgraph that

## #06 Projection
- [ ] Apply different methods of bipartite projectin (simple weighting, hyperbolic, hyperbolic2, vectorised projection, random walk)
- [ ] Analyse each method (using edge weight distribution, ...)
- [ ] Argue for which projection to use for recommendation system

## #7 Using Projected Graph
- [ ] Make some inital network statistics 
- [ ] Backboning of out network (try out different methods for backboning - argue for them)


## #07 Recommendation system
- [ ] Write for each node adjacent nodes ordered by decreasing edge weight 


## #08 Research question phrasing

## #09 Final
- [ ] Cleanup main notebook
- [ ] Presentation
- [ ] Reherse Presentation

## # Draft of a research question:
- "How can we use bipartite network to make accurate recommendations of github repositories?"
